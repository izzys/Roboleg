3 experients for each input signal [ 3 Logeritmic signal & 3 lineer signal ]
5 

0.1 - 5,10


*logeritmic is more slow then lineer.
* Advantage of having long test, more time at each position -> more accurate

[10 Hz - 4,6,8 minutes test]


* Two different input. Logeritmic & linner.

** different amplitude we chaking if the system linner --> how linner our system

* folder of each test -> type of input, range frequcnies, input amplitude, length


AFTER:
* Each test, in three different amplitudes  [ 25, 50 75 100 ]
